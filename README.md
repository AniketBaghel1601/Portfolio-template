## Tech Stacks Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

- HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
- CSS (Cascade Styling Sheet)

The webpage consists of three main sections: the header, body, and footer. HTML is used to add content, while CSS is used for styling and providing functionality.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three main sections:

1. **Header**: A section that introduces the portfolio, includes a logo, and provides navigation links to different parts of the portfolio.

## Project Planning

This project was assigned to us at the beginning of our construction week. After analyzing the project requirements, each team member took responsibility for one of the three main sections. We worked independently on our assigned sections and created daily branches to commit and push our work. Collaboration was smooth, and at the end, we merged the final code into the main branch, successfully completing the project.
