Healthy-discovery :-

This is a collaborative project that includes a group of four members. The healthy discovery is basically a webpage that reflects the structure and layout of the portfolio which is considered to be one of the most important documents for every developer. So, this website gives us the idea and the layout structure of a portfolio that creates a great impact for the viewers of the portfolio.

Members :-Â 

1. Shraddha Gawade (Team Leader)
2. Prity Rastogi
3. Aniket Baghel
4. Vikas Yadav


Tech stacks used:

This project includes the tech stacks named HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascade Styling Sheet).
The webpage consists of three sections, i.e., the header, body, and footer. We made use of HTML to add all the required content to our web page, and we used CSS to structure our web page in an attractive way and also to provide different styles and functionalities by making use of CSS properties.

Project Planning:

This project was assigned to us on the very first day of our construction week. After exploring the project, all four of us decided to distribute the three different sections between us and started working on it independently for the assigned sections. We created branches on the basis of each day in order to commit and push our work daily. At the end, we merged the final code into our main branch and successfully completed our project.

Conclusion :-

We successfully completed the assigned project for construct week. This project seems to be very beneficial for us because it led us to explore the tech stacks that we decided to use in this project. We perfectly aligned all the contents, which are to be displayed on our web page, and each and every piece of content is pixel-perfect and placed as mentioned in the sample provided to us. We all had a great experience working as a team on a collaborative project, and we would also like to thank our project mentor, Sir Rahul Rajeevan, for providing enough support and guidance to make this project successful.
